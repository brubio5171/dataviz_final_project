The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find a series of analyses that looks at the `fuel.csv` data set, which contains fuel economy data produced during vehicle testing from the 1984-2017. 

**Overall Highway MPG (1984-2017)**

## Project 02

In this project, I explored three different data sets using three different data visualization methods. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

**2017 Boston Marathon Runner Data Mapped Onto a World Shape File** 

_[International Runner Concentraion for 2017 Boston Marathon]_

## Project 03

In this project, I explored different data visualizations using data on weather in the Tampa area between 2016 and 2017.

**How Often Max Temperature was Recoded Each Month** 

_[Distibution of Maximum Temperatures Monthly]_

### Moving Forward

What I learned throughout this course and during this project was how to use a set of data provided to me in order to tell a story with a visualization, and how to change the story and the visualization depending on what I want to say with the results. I also learned alot of new things about R as a programming language, and most especially how to make use of the different packages available for R users, especially the `ggplot2` package. Moving forward, I want to continue to strengthen and expand my understanding of both coding and data analysis, and to do so while working on different personal projects in order to build up both my skill and my resume.
